    <p>
      I love to code! I have studied Data Analysis on DataQuest and am taking the Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp with Bloc. What I appreciate most about coding is being able to make something that people can use and will enhance their lives. I'm a problem solver and a technophile which I want to use to enrich peoples lives. When I am not building the front of a website, I love to geek out on the data I can get from it and how I can use it to improve the user experience.

      Coding isn't my only passion. My board game shelf is overflowing with games, my favorites being modern Euro style board games like Scythe. Additionally, I am a huge wine nerd. I even have a Certified Sommelier certificate to prove it! I appreciate sharing my knowledge about wine with people and engaging with them as to how the they perceive the wine in relation to aroma and taste. Feel free to contact me or follow me on social media and be sure to browse my projects!
